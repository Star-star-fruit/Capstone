Like a Boss

In order to help women and non-binary professionals write emails assertively, we created a text
editor to highlight minimizing language by performing sentiment analysis using Google's Natural  
Language API. A logged-in user is able to send emails through the Gmail API and we also render data
visualization of the most frequently used words based on saved drafts.

LikeaBoss envisions the spirit of how we want our users to communicate - it’s a text editor where
users can create, save, & edit drafts while being able to analyze the content through Google's
powerful, pre-trained sentiment analysis machine learning model.

Our tech stack consists of the usual suspects - Node, Express, React, Redux, and Postgres/Sequelize.

Other libraries that helped bring our user stories to life are react-draft-wysiwyg (a rich text editor based on Draft.js), mark.js for highlighting, react-wordcloud for data visualization, and the indispensable Material UI for styling.
